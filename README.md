### �� What I've learnt

I have learnt about functions, eventlisteners, JSON and even how to store items within the local storage
​
### ➕ Suggestions for improvement

A dark version of the quiz could be made or those who have the highest scores will be allowed to create questions. A function to share your score with friends would be good too.
